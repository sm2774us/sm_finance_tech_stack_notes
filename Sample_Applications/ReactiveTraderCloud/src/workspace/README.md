# Openfin Workspace

<img src="./screenshot.PNG">

The Reactive Trader Openfin Workspace Provider is a standalone application that registers a platform provider with Openfin. It is built separately to the Reactive Trader client, and deployed to the Openfin bucket in Google Cloud Storage (under the subfolder/workspace)

The manifest file is available at - `http://openfin.dev|uat|prod.reactivetrader.com/workspace/config/workspace.json`

Branch builds are located at - 
`http://openfin.env.reactivetrader.com/branch/branch_name/workspace/config/workspace.json`

PR builds are located at -
`http://openfin.env.reactivetrader.com/pull/pr_id/workspace/config/workspace.json`


## Running Locally

Run the Workspace Provider 

- `npm run start` to start the server
- `openfin:run` to launch the provider

Reactive Trader client will need to be running to open any RT based apps/views. `npm run openfin:dev` from the `src/client` directory

Reactive Analytics will need to be running to open the RA app/view. `npm run start` from the `ReactiveAnalytics/src` directory.

## Configs

Config files are located in [./config](./config).

Vite will replace placeholders at run/build time.

[workspace.json](./config/workspace.json) - This is the manifest file Openfin uses to run the workspace provider.

[snapshot.json](./config/snaphot.json) - An example of a 'snapshot'. This is what pages are saved as. The term snapshot and page are interchangeable.

`analytics, live-rates, trades & reactive-analytics.json` - Basic .json files that contain the bare minimum to launch a view in the Openfin browser using `platform.launchApp`

## Scripts

`npm start` - Starts the vite dev server

`npm run build` - Builds the application

`npm run openfin:run` - Launch the provider application in Openfin

`npm run openfin:start` - Start the server and launch the provider

`npm run kill`, `npm run kill:fin`, `npm run kill:rvm` - Kill the Openfin processes

## TODO

There is some duplication between client and workspace around the services and notifications. This requires some structural changes to the repo and some type alignment. This was not done during the initial work due to the 'spike' like nature of the task.
