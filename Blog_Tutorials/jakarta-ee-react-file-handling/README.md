# Codebase for the blog post [#HOWTO: Jakarta EE & React file up- and download using Java 11 and TypeScript](https://rieckpil.de/jakarta-ee-react-file-up-and-download-using-java-11-and-typescript)

Steps to run this project:

1. Clone this Git repository
2. Navigate to the folder `jakarta-ee-react-file-handling`
3. Build the application (frontend & backend) with `mvn package`
4. Deploy it to a local Payara 5.194 running on Java 11 (as there is currently no official Java 11 Payara Docker image available. I'll update this step once the image is available to have a more simple local deployment)
