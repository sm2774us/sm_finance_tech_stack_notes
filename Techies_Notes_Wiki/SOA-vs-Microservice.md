* **Microservices **architecture is an alternative approach to structuring applications. An application is broken into smaller, completely independent components, enabling them to have greater agility, scalability, and availability.

* **SOA **exposes the functions of applications as more readily accessible service interfaces, making it easier to use their data and logic in the next generation of applications.


An SOA appears to have an enterprise scope, where applications communicate with one another. An SOA exposes services through standardized interfaces between applications.

The microservices architecture appears to have an application scope, with a focus on the structure and components within an application.
