Basically Docker is a tool to package an application with its operating system, creating a VM-like image, and run it in so-called "containers". 

It improves the resource usage because it allows to run  multiple containers within a single VM, so you do not need to allocate a whole VM for a single service.

Docker disk images are smaller than VM's ones, because the operating system packaged with the application is "just enough" to run the application. No need to provide administrative tools, user interfaces, and so on.

Also, disk images are "layered" and a layer can be shared among multiple images. You can have for example an operating system core reused between multiple different images and save a lot of space.

Ideally each container should run only one application. An application in a docker container is run like a process, not like a VM, with less overhead, so there is minor cpu consumption and less idle states.

Also the memory used in a VM is shared between the various containers, resulting in way less memory consumption (and much more memory reuse).




List all Docker Images

    docker images -a

List All Running Docker Containers

    docker ps

List All Docker Containers

   docker ps -a

Start a Docker Container

    docker start <container name>

Stop a Docker Container

    docker stop <container name>

Kill All Running Containers

    docker kill $(docker ps -q)

View the logs of a Running Docker Container

    docker logs <container name>

Delete All Stopped Docker Containers

   Use -f option to nuke the running containers too.

    docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

Remove a Docker Image

    docker rmi <image name>

Delete All Docker Images

    docker rmi $(docker images -q)

Delete All Untagged (dangling) Docker Images

    docker rmi $(docker images -q -f dangling=true)

Delete All Images

    docker rmi $(docker images -q)

Remove Dangling Volumes

    docker volume rm -f $(docker volume ls -f dangling=true -q)

SSH Into a Running Docker Container


     sudo docker exec -it <container name> bash

Use Docker Compose to Build Containers
Run from directory of your docker-compose.yml file.


    docker-compose build

Use Docker Compose to Start a Group of Containers
Use this command from directory of your docker-compose.yml file.


    docker-compose up -d

This will tell Docker to fetch the latest version of the container from the repo, and not use the local cache.


    docker-compose up -d --force-recreate

This can be problematic if youâ€™re doing CI builds with Jenkins and pushing Docker images to another host, or using for CI testing. I was deploying a Spring Boot Web Application from Jekins, and found the docker container was not getting refreshed with the latest Spring Boot artifact.


     #stop docker containers, and rebuild
     docker-compose stop -t 1
     docker-compose rm -f
     docker-compose pull
     docker-compose build
     docker-compose up -d

    #stop docker containers, and rebuild
    docker-compose stop -t 1
    docker-compose rm -f
    docker-compose pull
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d

Follow the Logs of Running Docker Containers With Docker Compose

    docker-compose logs -f

Save a Running Docker Container as an Image


    docker commit <image name> <name for image>

Follow the logs of one container running under Docker Compose


     docker-compose logs pump <name>
