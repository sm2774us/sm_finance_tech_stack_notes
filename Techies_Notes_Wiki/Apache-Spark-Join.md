**Apache Spark Join**


![](http://kirillpavlov.com/images/join-types.png)



Employees table has a nullable column. To express it in terms of statically typed Scala, one needs to use Option type.

**Tables:**

   val employees = sc.parallelize(Array[(String, Option[Int])](
     ("Rafferty", Some(31)), ("Jones", Some(33)), ("Heisenberg", Some(33)), ("Robinson", Some(34)), ("Smith", Some(34)), 
    ("Williams", null)
    )).toDF("LastName", "DepartmentID")

employees.show()

   +----------+------------+
   |  LastName|DepartmentID|
   +----------+------------+
   |  Rafferty|          31|
   |     Jones|          33|
   |Heisenberg|          33|
   |  Robinson|          34|
   |     Smith|          34|
   |  Williams|        null|
   +----------+------------+


Department table does not have nullable columns, type specification could be omitted.

val departments = sc.parallelize(Array(
  (31, "Sales"), (33, "Engineering"), (34, "Clerical"),
  (35, "Marketing")
)).toDF("DepartmentID", "DepartmentName")

departments.show()

+------------+--------------+
|DepartmentID|DepartmentName|
+------------+--------------+
|          31|         Sales|
|          33|   Engineering|
|          34|      Clerical|
|          35|     Marketing|
+------------+--------------+


**Inner join**
Following SQL code

SELECT *
FROM employee 
INNER JOIN department
ON employee.DepartmentID = department.DepartmentID;
could be written in Spark as

employees
  .join(departments, "DepartmentID")
  .show()


+------------+----------+--------------+
|DepartmentID|  LastName|DepartmentName|
+------------+----------+--------------+
|          31|  Rafferty|         Sales|
|          33|     Jones|   Engineering|
|          33|Heisenberg|   Engineering|
|          34|  Robinson|      Clerical|
|          34|     Smith|      Clerical|
+------------+----------+--------------+


Beautiful, is not it? Spark automatically removes duplicated “DepartmentID” column, so column names are unique and one does not need to use table prefix to address them.

**Left outer join**
Left outer join is a very common operation, especially if there are nulls or gaps in a data. Note, that column name should be wrapped into scala Seq if join type is specified.

employees
  .join(departments, Seq("DepartmentID"), "left_outer")
  .show()

+------------+----------+--------------+
|DepartmentID|  LastName|DepartmentName|
+------------+----------+--------------+
|          31|  Rafferty|         Sales|
|          33|     Jones|   Engineering|
|          33|Heisenberg|   Engineering|
|          34|  Robinson|      Clerical|
|          34|     Smith|      Clerical|
|        null|  Williams|          null|
+------------+----------+--------------+


**Other join types**

Spark allows using following join types: inner, outer, left_outer, right_outer, leftsemi. The interface is the same as for left outer join in the example above.

For cartesian join column specification should be omitted:

employees
  .join(departments)
  .show(10)

+----------+------------+------------+--------------+
|  LastName|DepartmentID|DepartmentID|DepartmentName|
+----------+------------+------------+--------------+
|  Rafferty|          31|          31|         Sales|
|  Rafferty|          31|          33|   Engineering|
|  Rafferty|          31|          34|      Clerical|
|  Rafferty|          31|          35|     Marketing|
|     Jones|          33|          31|         Sales|
|     Jones|          33|          33|   Engineering|
|     Jones|          33|          34|      Clerical|
|     Jones|          33|          35|     Marketing|
|Heisenberg|          33|          31|         Sales|
|Heisenberg|          33|          33|   Engineering|
+----------+------------+------------+--------------+

Warning: do not use cartesian join with big tables in production.

Join expression, slowly changing dimensions and non-equi join
Spark allows us to specify join expression instead of a sequence of columns. In general, expression specification is less readable, so why do we need such flexibility? The reason is non-equi join.

One application of it is slowly changing dimensions. Assume there is a table with product prices over time:

val products = sc.parallelize(Array(
  ("steak", "1990-01-01", "2000-01-01", 150),
  ("steak", "2000-01-02", "2020-01-01", 180),
  ("fish", "1990-01-01", "2020-01-01", 100)
)).toDF("name", "startDate", "endDate", "price")

products.show()

+-----+----------+----------+-----+
| name| startDate|   endDate|price|
+-----+----------+----------+-----+
|steak|1990-01-01|2000-01-01|  150|
|steak|2000-01-02|2020-01-01|  180|
| fish|1990-01-01|2020-01-01|  100|
+-----+----------+----------+-----+


There are two products only: steak and fish, price of steak has been changed once. Another table consists of product orders by day:

val orders = sc.parallelize(Array(
  ("1995-01-01", "steak"),
  ("2000-01-01", "fish"),
  ("2005-01-01", "steak")
)).toDF("date", "product")

orders.show()

+----------+-------+
|      date|product|
+----------+-------+
|1995-01-01|  steak|
|2000-01-01|   fish|
|2005-01-01|  steak|
+----------+-------+


Our goal is to assign an actual price for every record in the orders table. It is not obvious to do using only equality operators, however, spark join expression allows us to achieve the result in an elegant way:

orders
  .join(products, $"product" === $"name" && $"date" >= $"startDate" && $"date" <= $"endDate")
  .show()

+----------+-------+-----+----------+----------+-----+
|      date|product| name| startDate|   endDate|price|
+----------+-------+-----+----------+----------+-----+
|2000-01-01|   fish| fish|1990-01-01|2020-01-01|  100|
|1995-01-01|  steak|steak|1990-01-01|2000-01-01|  150|
|2005-01-01|  steak|steak|2000-01-02|2020-01-01|  180|
+----------+-------+-----+----------+----------+-----+


This technique is very useful, yet not that common. It could save a lot of time for those who write as well as for those who read the code.

Inner join using non primary keys
Last part of this article is about joins on non unique columns and common mistakes related to it. Join (intersection) diagrams in the beginning of this article stuck in our heads. Because of visual comparison of sets intersection we assume, that result table after inner join should be smaller, than any of the source tables. This is correct only for joins on unique columns and wrong if columns in both tables are not unique. Consider following DataFrame with duplicated records and its self-join:

val df = sc.parallelize(Array(
  (0), (1), (1)
)).toDF("c1")

df.show()
df.join(df, "c1").show()

// Original DataFrame

+---+
| c1|
+---+
|  0|
|  1|
|  1|
+---+

// Self-joined DataFrame

+---+
| c1|
+---+
|  0|
|  1|
|  1|
|  1|
|  1|
+---+


Note, that size of the result DataFrame is bigger than the source size. It could be as big as n2, where n is a size of source.
