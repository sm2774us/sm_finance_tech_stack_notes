# Guiding Principles

The core values contained in the Agile Manifesto motivate a set of guiding principles for DW/BI systems design and development. These principles often become the tiebreaker when difficult trade-off decisions must be made. Similarly, the Agile Alliance has established a set of principles for software development. The following Agile Analytics principles borrow liberally from the Agile Alliance principles:

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the DW/BI user community through early and continuous delivery of working user features.

* We welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the DW/BI users' competitive advantage.

* We deliver working software frequently, providing users with new DW/BI features every few weeks.

* Users, stakeholders, and developers must share project ownership and work together daily throughout the project.

* We value the importance of talented and experienced business intelligence experts. We give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.

* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

* A working business intelligence system is the primary measure of progress.

* We recognize the balance among project scope, schedule, and cost. The data warehousing team must work at a sustainable pace.

* Continuous attention to the best data warehousing practices enhances agility.

* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
